For this cipher text I used a java class, VigenereCipher I created to find both the key and the length, despite the length already being provided it was a good test to see if I could use the same code for exercise 4. I found the key length and then continued to find the actual key, I split the cipher text into strings of 6 letters in length then analysed each position individually in each word, finding the frequency distribution for each position, then multiplying these values against the english alphabet frequency distribution and adding them together, I then shifted the frequency distributions for the cipher text so now the english alphabet letter A's frequency was multiplied against Cipher text's B frequency, this continued and the shift with the highest multiplication became the shift key for that letter in the key. I continued doing this until I had the entire key, then decrypting the code as I did for exercise 2.
