For the transposition cipher I wrote another Java class, TranspositionCipher that would take the cipher text and a range of how long the word might be. I then worked out every combination of numbers for each length of the word, with these combinations I then rearranged the code for by cutting it up into several strings, the same amount of strings as the length of the key, I then rearranged the strings into columns based on the combination of numbers created, I then connected all the lines into one string. Since I already knew the formation of how the columns were originally positions I did not need to go any further and simply looked at the strings for the first combination of 4,5 and 6, combinations 1234,12345 and 123456 respectively, to find the correct string. To confirm though, after changing the code for exercise 6, the code does work and find the correct answer without manual observation.
